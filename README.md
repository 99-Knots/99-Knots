### Hi there, I'm 99-Knots! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my humble portfolio of little side projects! <br>
While these projects are primarily a means for me to challenge my existing skills and develop new ones, they might maybe even be of use to someone else.

I can produce running code in Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, GLSL, sometimes even C++ and my HTML/CSS renders ***at least*** 83% of the time (give or take)!
